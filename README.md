NSF_GRFP_Essays
===============

Copies of the essays I submitted for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship back in 2011. (Was awarded.)

I've only included the Personal Statement here, if you're interested in the Proposed Research essay or Previous Experience essay, let me know.
Apparently the NSF changed this to just two essays this upcoming year (nixing the Previous Experience), so the format of my essay may no longer apply.
This is the PDF that I sent directly in to the NSF, with this formatting - I got the trick of bolding key words and separating out paragraphs from another friend who also got a GRF.

Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you'd like more resources.
