NSF_GRFP_Essays
===============

Copies of the essays I submitted for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship back in 2011. (Was awarded.)

Though I've included all three essays I submitted, I'd suggest focusing more on the personal statement.
Apparently the NSF changed this to just two essays recently (nixing the Previous Experience), so the format of my essay may no longer apply.
This is the PDF that I sent directly in to the NSF, with this formatting - I got the trick of bolding key words and separating out paragraphs from another friend who also got a GRF.

Also included are the reviews I received. Note that they misinterpreted part of my personal statement relating to diversity - I've been told that this happens every once and a while and not to worry about it. That's part of the reason why the bolding of certain text can be so important.

Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you'd like more resources.
