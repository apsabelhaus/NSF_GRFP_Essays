NSF_GRFP_Essays
===============

Copies of the essays I submitted for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship back in 2011. (Was awarded.)

Though I've included all three essays I submitted, I'd suggest focusing more on the personal statement.
The NSF changed this to just two essays recently (removing the Previous Experience), so the format of my essay may no longer apply.
This is the PDF that I sent directly in to the NSF, with this formatting - I got the trick of bolding key words and separating out paragraphs from another friend who also got a GRF (credit to Ethan Schaler.)

Also included are the reviews I received. Note that they misinterpreted part of my personal statement relating to diversity - do not assume that the reviewers will read your essays thoroughly enough to not make mistakes; they made a big mistake here. That's part of the reason why the bolding of certain text can be so important.

Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you'd like more resources.
